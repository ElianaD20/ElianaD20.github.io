# Survey Analysis of Student Satisfaction in Online Learning

## Overview
This project analyzes student satisfaction levels in online learning, aiming to uncover the factors influencing adaptation to online education. By examining survey data from 1,205 students, the project investigates the impact of demographics, access to technology, and institutional support on student adaptability. The findings are intended to inform strategies that can enhance the online learning experience, providing actionable insights for educational institutions and policymakers.

## Tools Used
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy
- **Data Visualization**: Pie charts, bar charts
- **Data Source**: [Survey Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdmahmudulhasansuzan/students-adaptability-level-in-online-
education) (CSV format)

## Key Findings
1. **Adaptability Distribution**: The majority of students face challenges in adapting to online learning, with only 7.6% reporting high adaptation levels.
2. **IT vs. Non-IT Students**: IT students exhibit slightly better adaptability, but the difference is not statistically significant.
3. **Institution Type Impact**: Students from non-government institutions report higher adaptability scores, suggesting that these institutions may offer more effective support for online learning.
4. **Demographic Influences**: Financial condition, network reliability, and use of self-directed learning management systems are positively associated with better adaptability.

### 3. Adaptivity by Institution Type
This bar chart displays the adaptability scores of students from government and non-government institutions, showing that students from non-government institutions have higher adaptability. This suggests that non-government institutions may provide more effective support for online learning.
